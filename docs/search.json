An important interaction revealed that loyal business travelers are significantly more likely to be satisfied, highlighting the value of tailored loyalty strategies. Conversely, food quality, seat comfort, and legroom had negative effects, indicating improvement opportunities. Recommendations include improving in-flight WiFi, streamlining digital processes, enhancing loyalty benefits for frequent business travelers, and investing in seat and food upgrades to improve satisfaction across all passenger segments."

Common themes included: - Summarizing complex content - Generating ideas and brainstorming - Clarifying difficult assignments\n\n“I mainly use it to help me summarize harder assignments.”\n“Step-by-step learning with integrations.”\n\nThe most frequent words included learning, experience, ideas, and brainstorming — suggesting that students value AI tools as support for deeper understanding.\n📊 Bar chart (right): Displays top 10 words by frequency, colored from cooler to warmer tones.\n\n\n\n2. Student Concerns About AI\nStudents expressed several key concerns: - Accuracy: Worries about incorrect or unclear responses - Trust: Uncertainty about reliability of AI-generated content - Privacy: Discomfort with data collection or usage\n\n“The biggest concern is knowing how much I can trust the tool.”\n“Over-reliance on data, lack of personal creativity.”\n\n☁️ Word cloud (right): Visualizes the most commonly mentioned concerns — the larger the word, the more often it appeared.\n\n\n\n3. Student Recommendations for AI Policy\nUsing topic modeling, we identified three major policy-related themes:\n\nTransparency: Students want to disclose when and how AI is used\nRubrics: Clear grading guidelines that account for AI usage\nSimple Documentation: Easy ways to cite or report AI assistance\n\n\n“Just say if you used it or not or cite sources.”\n“Most likely the rubric, because you will be submitting work regardless of how much AI was used.”\n\n📊 Bar chart: Shows top keywords across the three identified topics."
