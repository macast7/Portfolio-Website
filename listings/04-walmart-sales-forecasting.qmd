## Overview

This project focused on forecasting weekly sales for **Store 1, Department 72** at Walmart using time series models. The goal was to predict future sales using both historical patterns and external economic indicators such as temperature, fuel price, and holidays.

The analysis included baseline forecasting using SNAIVE and advanced modeling with ARIMA plus regressors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Objectives

-   Visualize weekly sales trends and related economic indicators
-   Measure correlations between sales and factors like CPI, fuel prices, and unemployment
-   Build and evaluate SNAIVE and ARIMA models
-   Assess forecast accuracy using average error and RMSE

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methods

-   **Time Series Structure**: Data converted into tsibble with weekly granularity
-   **Exploratory Plots**:
    -   Sales over time (full and 1-year snapshot)
    -   External drivers: Temperature, Fuel Price, CPI, and Unemployment
-   **Correlation Analysis**:
    -   Pearson & Spearman matrices visualized with `corrplot`
-   **Models Built**:
    -   `SNAIVE`: Seasonal naive model as a benchmark
    -   `ARIMA`: With regressors (IsHoliday, Temperature, Fuel_Price)
-   **Forecast Accuracy**:
    -   Compared actual vs forecast for 52 weeks
    -   Error metrics: Average Error, RMSE

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Results

-   **SNAIVE RMSE**: \~2192\
-   **ARIMA RMSE**: \~1985

ARIMA with regressors outperformed the seasonal naive model, capturing effects from holidays and temperature changes. Visualization of actual vs. forecasted values showed close alignment for both models, with ARIMA providing a more stable fit.

## Tools Used

-   R (`fpp3`, `fable`, `tsibble`, `ggplot2`, `corrplot`)
-   Quarto (for reporting and visualization)
