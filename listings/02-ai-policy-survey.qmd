## Overview

This project analyzed open-ended survey responses from university students about how they use AI in business education, their concerns, and what AI policies they believe would promote ethical use.

The analysis was conducted as part of a research initiative for **Statistics Without Borders**, a nonprofit that supports ethical data use in education and consulting. Our goal was to identify actionable policy recommendations based on real student input.

## Key Findings

### 1. How Students Use AI

Students described using AI as a **learning aid** rather than a shortcut. Common themes included:
- Summarizing complex content
- Generating ideas and brainstorming
- Clarifying difficult assignments

> ‚ÄúI mainly use it to help me summarize harder assignments.‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúStep-by-step learning with integrations.‚Äù

The most frequent words included **learning**, **experience**, **ideas**, and **brainstorming** ‚Äî suggesting that students value AI tools as support for deeper understanding.

### 2. Student Concerns About AI

Students expressed several key concerns:
- **Accuracy**: Worries about incorrect or unclear responses
- **Trust**: Uncertainty about reliability of AI-generated content
- **Privacy**: Discomfort with data collection or usage

> ‚ÄúThe biggest concern is knowing how much I can trust the tool.‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúOver-reliance on data, lack of personal creativity.‚Äù

### 3. Student Recommendations for AI Policy

Using topic modeling, we identified three major policy-related themes:

- **Transparency**: Students want to disclose when and how AI is used
- **Rubrics**: Clear grading guidelines that account for AI usage
- **Simple Documentation**: Easy ways to cite or report AI assistance

> ‚ÄúJust say if you used it or not or cite sources.‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúMost likely the rubric, because you will be submitting work regardless of how much AI was used.‚Äù

üìä *Bar chart*: Shows top keywords across the three identified topics.

## Methods

- **Text Analysis**: Word frequency, word clouds, and LDA topic modeling
- **Tools**: R (`tidytext`, `topicmodels`, `ggplot2`), Quarto
- **Data**: Open-ended survey responses from undergraduate students at a California university

---

## Outcome

The findings were used to propose a student-informed AI policy framework with three pillars:
1. Encourage **transparent disclosures**
2. Align **grading rubrics** with ethical AI use
3. Simplify **documentation and citation** processes

These results are currently being used to inform ongoing work by **Statistics Without Borders** on developing AI policies for education and consulting settings.
