## Overview

This project explores how students at Cal Poly Pomona use social media platforms to build a sense of community, network, and seek academic support. Based on survey responses, the study investigates the **relationship between platform use (Instagram, TikTok, Discord, Facebook)** and four outcomes:

-   Sense of Community
-   Networking Opportunities
-   Academic Support
-   Overall College Experience

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methods

-   **Survey Data**: Cleaned and recoded Likert and categorical responses
-   **Imputation**: Replaced missing values with mean (numerics) and mode (categoricals)
-   **Re-encoding**: Mapped social media platforms to numeric categories
-   **Analysis**:
    -   Conducted **MANOVA** with platform usage as predictors
    -   Examined **individual ANOVAs** for each dependent variable
-   **Visualization**:
    -   Boxplots comparing platform usage with outcome scores
    -   Bar chart of average impact scores per platform

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Findings

### MANOVA Results

The analysis showed significant effects of platform usage on multiple dimensions of community-building: - **Discord** had the strongest association with **academic support** - **Instagram** was positively linked to **sense of community** - **TikTok** and **Facebook** showed weaker or inconsistent patterns

ðŸ“‹ *P-values* were computed for each dependent variable, summarized in a table for all predictors.

### Visual Insights

-   **Boxplots** revealed higher median sense-of-community scores for active Instagram users
-   **Bar chart** showed Discord as the top platform for academic-related support

> Example Insight: "Students who use Discord report higher academic support ratings, while Instagram users report stronger social connection."
