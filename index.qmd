## About Me

I hold a [Master of Science in Digital Marketing]{.highlight} from Cal Poly Pomona, where I focused on data-driven decision-making, customer behavior analysis, and digital strategy.

As an aspiring **Market Insights Analyst**, I thrive at the intersection of marketing and analytics. My academic projects and hands-on experience have centered on extracting actionable insights from survey data, web analytics, and customer segmentation models. Whether I’m evaluating satisfaction drivers in the airline industry or running A/B tests to optimize digital campaigns, my goal is always the same: to turn complex data into clear, strategic recommendations.

I bring strong proficiency in tools like **R**, **SQL**, and **Excel**, and I’m experienced in creating compelling dashboards, reports, and presentations using **Quarto**, **ggplot2**, and **Power BI**. I'm especially passionate about helping organizations better understand their customers and make evidence-based marketing decisions.
